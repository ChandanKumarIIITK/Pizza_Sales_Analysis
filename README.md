# Pizza Sales Analysis - Power BI Dashboard
## Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze pizza sales data to derive key business insights and trends. By leveraging Power BI, we created an interactive dashboard to visualize sales performance, best and worst-selling pizzas, daily/monthly sales trends, and customer ordering behavior. The project involves data cleaning, transformation, and creating DAX measures to generate meaningful insights.

## Power BI Questions: 
1. What is the total revenue, total pizzas sold, and total orders?
2. What are the busiest days and times for pizza sales?
3. Which pizza category and size contribute the most to sales?
4. What are the top-selling and least-selling pizzas in terms of revenue, quantity, and orders?
5. How do sales trends vary across days and months?
6. What is the average order value and the average number of pizzas per order?

## Process of the Project: Pizza Sales Analysis
Step 1: Data Collection & Cleaning
1. The dataset was sourced from an Excel file containing pizza sales transactions.
2. Cleaned and formatted data using Power Query (removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized column names).

Step 2: SQL Data Transformation
1. Used SQL queries to extract, filter, and aggregate data.
2. Performed data validation and integrity checks.

Step 3: Data Modeling & DAX Measures
1. Created relationships between tables for better data connectivity.
2. Developed DAX measures to calculate:
Total Revenue
Total Orders
Total Pizzas Sold
Average Order Value
Percentage Sales Contribution by Category & Size

Step 4: Power BI Dashboard Development
1. Designed an interactive dashboard with:
2. Key KPIs for sales metrics.
3. Bar, line, and pie charts to represent trends.
4. Filters & slicers for detailed analysis.


## Project Insights:
